This is the very basic auto-email sorter that makes my life as a project manager easier. 
Rules: 
1) make a sub-folder under Inbox, to sort all the incoming staff that deserves sitting in your Outlook for ages, but you never know when you will need it
2) make sub-folders in this root folder, organized by sender mail domains
3) let the sorter put emails there.

If you have just a couple of folders, you of course will not needed this add-in. I have about 100..
